# HANDOFF — 2026-08-15 (the classifier: possession, the gate, and the ramp) — alpha only

Branch **alpha**, commit `c65209a`, **103 commits ahead of `origin/main`**.
`npm test` ALL PASS (~215 checks) · `npm run build` green · working tree clean.
**Not deployed.** Production `dohun-sim-decode` is still on the pre-session build and
still owes the migrations listed under "Still pending".

Do not merge to main. Standing rule.

## Where the session ended

The last three fixes are all in the DECODE classifier, and the last one closes the loop
the user opened with *"make a FUNDAMENTAL change and make it correct FUNDAMENTALLY."*

### The ramp is now ONE physics (`20b97a1`)

`OVERFLOW_FLOW_SPEED` is gone. It handed overflow artifacts a fixed 16 in/s down a
separate code path, which is why they crawled and why an opening gate could not reach
them. Every artifact on the ramp now runs the same solver — gravity `RAIL_ACCEL`,
contact stacking, one queue — and `overflow` means only two things:

1. the scoring flag, still decided at first contact (unchanged), and
2. **height**. An artifact is `elevated` while anything retained sits below it. That
   costs it `OVERFLOW_DRAG` rolling resistance (terminal ride ≈ `RAIL_ACCEL /
   OVERFLOW_DRAG`, ~36 in/s against the clear ramp's 46) and exempts it from the gate.

It sinks the moment there is nothing left to ride on — so an opening gate drains the
column out from under it and it simply follows, at ramp speed, on the ramp. Nothing
about it was ever special except its height.

**The trap, which cost most of a session.** The rail solver has TWO constraints and they
are not the same kind of thing:

- the artifact **AHEAD** — unconditional, artifacts cannot pass through each other;
- the **BASE** (the gate, or an occupied mouth) — a floor only for artifacts *above* it.

Conflating them broke this twice. Both unconditional, and a base that MOVES (`canLeave`
flips as a robot turns near the mouth) dragged the whole column back UP the ramp in time
with the steering. Both gated on "was it above this last tick", and an artifact dipping a
hair below its neighbour free-fell through the entire column and out through a shut gate
(measured: id 906 passing s=2.5 at 46 in/s with its floor at 7.1). **That second failure
survived a full session of a green suite** — smoke never checked that a closed gate
retains anything. It does now: three checks that nine artifacts stay put for five
seconds, packed at exactly `RAIL_PITCH` against the gate, scoring nothing.

### The gate discharges off a LIP (`c65209a`)

An artifact leaving the ramp used to be handed a flat floor velocity on the tick it
crossed the exit, on a fan 10–29° off the wall — nine of them left on the same diagonal
at 46 in/s and ran out across the floor. That was *"hyper accelerated and all going
diagonally in one direction"*.

The ramp does not discharge at floor level. The manual puts the gate's contact area
3.75–5.5 in up (9.8.3), so it is released as a **flight** artifact at `GATE_LIP_Z`
carrying its ramp momentum and the existing ballistic code does the rest: gravity, a
landing bounce keeping `BALL_BOUNCE_H_RETAIN`, then rolling friction. The speed comes out
because it *lands*; the scatter comes from where each one lands and from caroming off
whichever stopped first. With the drop doing that work, `TUNNEL_EXIT_VEL.inward` dropped
8 → 4. Measured over a full nine-artifact drain: **22–42 in from the mouth** (tunnel is
46.5 in long), **3–18 in off the wall** against a 6.1 in tunnel, median 7.

`target` is required by the flight state and meaningless here; it is read only by
`checkGoalEntry`, which also needs an UPWARD crossing of `GOAL_OPENING_Z` within
`GOAL_OPENING_RADIUS`. This artifact starts below that plane, falling, 60 in away.

### Earlier in the session

- **G408 over-possession** rebuilt on the manual's actual POSSESSION test (position in
  the robot frame, transitive chain from confirmed seeds) plus the real card model —
  MINOR **5** / MAJOR **15**, yellow at simultaneous 5 or three instances of 4+. The rule
  had been fouling the wrong robot and was switched off by a threshold set below its own
  signal.
- **The classifier ends AT the gate** — the rect used to run three inches past it and was
  drawn as a wall on the short end. Stroked on three sides now.
- **The mouth is a PLACE** — artifacts stop teleporting into a parked robot, and the
  doorway nudge sets a FLOOR on outward speed rather than adding every tick (it compounded
  to 91 in/s).
- **Chain Reaction**: flywheel launcher straddling the turret feed hole, beams apply yaw
  torque, mobile THROW button (hidden when the assist owns the action).

## Gotchas earned here

- **`npm test` passing is not evidence for anything it does not check.** Two of this
  session's three worst bugs were invisible to a green suite. Every behaviour the user
  reports twice now has a check; keep that up.
- **Probe, then change.** Several reports were refuted by measurement rather than fixed:
  the flick-shuttle carried 18 in for zero fouls where a shove carried 9 for three; chassis
  penetration by an artifact measured 0.00 in over 0 frames.
- The human player **restocks during teleop**, so any probe that measures "where the balls
  ended up" must filter to the ids it spawned. An earlier "max 148 in" reading was three
  loading-zone restocks, not drain artifacts.
- `Math.hypot` is banned in sim source by the smoke guard — use `hyp` from `src/math`.
  `Math.max/min/sign/PI` are fine.

## Open, not started

- **"Balls still pass over the robot."** Not reproduced. Chassis penetration measures
  0.00 in, and `ballRobotContact` leaves the intake mouth open *by design* — which is what
  the earlier "2.77 in penetration" reading actually was. Needs the user's specific
  scenario before more code is written against it.
- **Penalty hitbox audit** (roadmap #1) — the rules are right, the trigger volumes have
  never been checked against the manual figures.
- **Production deploy**: prod is on migration 0024; 0025–0029 plus the 08-07 spectating
  batch are pending. `./scripts/fly-deploy.sh` — **never a bare `flyctl deploy`**.
- Red cards are unreachable (G408 is the only card source and cannot issue a second
  yellow).
- "Replays for tank drive dont seem to be working" — `eb45f01` fixed recording; unverified
  end to end.
- `CLASSIFIER_W` 6 in vs `TUNNEL_W` 6.125 in — ⅛ in mismatch, noted, not changed.
- **At the alpha→main merge**: start a new Chain Reaction season from the admin menu.
  DECODE does NOT roll. Do not bump `BALANCE_VERSION`.
